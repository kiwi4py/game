simple work with pygame for kids
Winter vacation is coming. I want to teach my relatives' kids a little bit of programming
to make them known that programming is a wonderful thing at an early age. Maybe one day
when they do well in compter science or start a star company, they should feel quite lucky
to be familiar with programming very young. :) (They might feel it quite boring and thus hate
me.) I am not that lucky as the younger generation who are access to computer. And someone tells
them computer science is not jus meaning word processor, or sheet, or drawing panel but a super
power to manipulate computer to do many fasinating things.
Games or simple animations will be written in Python. Please feel free to alter the codes. I
am not quite good at programming but just love it. Hope you will enjoy it.
